# Docs for Sample Target

This is a pure javascript sample target for PXT. For more information about setting your own target, see https://pxt.io/docs .

You can embed code snippets.

```blocks
control.forever(() => {
    turtle.turn(Direction.Left, 10);
    turtle.forward(1);
});
```

Or embed blocks inline, `[control.forever(() => {})]` and many other features in our augmented markdown.
